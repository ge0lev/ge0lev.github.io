Hey there 👋,

I'm George (ge0lev) - welcome to my personal blog! I'm a Threat Hunter at an MSSP,Climbed the SOC ladder from L1 to L2 to Threat Hunting. I have always been interested in malicious software, how to analyse it, figure out what it does, why it does it and finally how to detect it.

This blog is a mix of: personal notes and things I find interesting. These include: 
* (possibly half-baked) Malware analysis and Reversing 
* Threat hunting
* (Basic) Detection Engineering
* Malware/crackmes writeups
* Whatever else happens to pique my interest...

You can find me on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/ge0lev) and [Discord](https://discord.com/users/239787992368021504).
